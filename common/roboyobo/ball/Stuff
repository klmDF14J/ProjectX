TODO: 
	
	-Finish battle mode, actually add gameplay, waiting on new entity system before doing this
	
	-Add items where u can only have one a day etc in the shop
	
	-Finish up HUD (needs health bar and charge level)
	
	-Battle mode needs to be disabled until done
	
	-Fix rocks glitching on each other (Hopefully with new entity system)
	
	-Redo language system to read from file (Tricky)
	
	-Find a good place to put the title on the menu
	
	-(Non-major) Find a nicer way to handle the menu orientation. Buttons dont update proper so I'm just maintaining 3 instances of it
	
	-Work on tooltips for the shop (NEXT PRIORITY, fairly simple but needs to be done otherwise I'll forget)
	
	-Render current amount of items in the stack on the shop item
	
	-Proper way to buy things, work on token system and have a buy size dialog box
	
	-Add music to game (Code on laptop)
